## Strategies to implement
### Mean Reversion
The mean reversion strategy is based on a straightforward assumption – if the price of a coin shift from its average, then it’s eventually going to revert back to it. 

### Momentum Trading
The core philosophy behind this is the belief that the prices of an asset will spike above its average and then run out of momentum and fall down. 

### Naive Bayes
